<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  In 2013, I embarked on a journey from Japan to Canada, marking the beginning of my English language learning experience. After returning to Japan briefly in 2015, I started preparing for my enrollment in a Canadian college. The year 2016 witnessed my dedicated pursuit of a two-year study in Baking and Pastry Arts Management, culminating in the acquisition of a valuable diploma.</p>
<p>Following my academic achievements, I delved into the culinary world, spending four years as a chocolate and gelato maker in a renowned chocolate store. Subsequently, I transitioned to a pastry store that uniquely fused the flavors of Japanese and French confections, where I contributed my skills and creativity.</p>
<p>Presently, I wear the hats of both a gelato chef and a baker, leveraging my expertise in crafting delightful frozen treats and delectable baked goods. Additionally, I've taken on the responsibility of managing a brunch restaurant, where I bring my passion for culinary arts into the operational aspects of the establishment.</p>
